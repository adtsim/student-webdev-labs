## Reflection Document

### HTML

**01-html**

❏ Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?
->I was able to complete the exercises on my own.

❏ How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?
->The exercises in this section were very helpful in getting started with the basic html elements and their layouts. I found the exercise on form particularly helpful because a form includes multiple properties and attributes within it and this exercise helped me understand the meaning of each of those and what their roles are.

❏ Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
->No.

❏ Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
topic a little better?
->No.
