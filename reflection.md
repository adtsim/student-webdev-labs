### Accessibility

**01-html**

All the four exercises have been checked for accessibility using the Wave extension as well as the W3C Markup Validation tool for HTML. There were no errors encountered in either of these tools.

**NOTE :** The link provided for loading the puppy images is probably no longer valid, hence the webpage does not load up any puppy images in the "02-images.html" exercise. Kindly suggest an alternate link for the same since it may appear as an accessibility issue.

**02-a11y**

The form exercise has been checked for accessibility using the Wave extension as well as the W3C Markup Validation tool for HTML. There were no errors encountered in either of these tools.

**03-css**
